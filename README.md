Titanic Dataset Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning
Executed a full machine learning workflow on the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. Conducted data cleaning, handled missing values in 'Age' and 'Embarked', and applied label encoding on categorical variables like 'Sex' and 'Embarked'. Performed feature engineering by selecting impactful features such as Pclass, Sex, Fare, and Age. Trained and evaluated a Logistic Regression model, achieving high accuracy using train-test split and performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix. Tools used include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
